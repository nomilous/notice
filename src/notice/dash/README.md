Web Dashboard and Hub Control API
=================================

### keep in mind

* multiple possible hubs (in the same server process)
* the pending/still.abstract idea of **notification channels**
* pending hub uplink-ability enables n-tier star topologies
* considering replacing socket.io-client as the uplinker to enable mesh
* implement as api (keep dashbord ui component server separate) 
* ?multiple websockets? from browser to each hub (doubtful that's possible?)
