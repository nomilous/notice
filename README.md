A communicator. Also for other stuff.


### The Guiding Epiphanies

* Middleware can be hot-swapped.
* Middleware is perfect for routing information streams.
* Their flow-control and sequencial subscribe-ability describes a dynamic assembly line.
* An assembly (or disassembly) line can abstractify object storage and retreival.


### Quick Faqts

* all examples use coffee-script
* docs @ [`./spec/notice`](./spec/notice)
* example walkthrough @ [`../notice-example`](../notice-example)

### Also, Important

* Objects traversing a middleware pipeline can overtake each other.
