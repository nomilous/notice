### The Guiding Epiphanies

* A middleware bus is conceptionally identical to a promise pipeline.
* The resulting flow-control and sequencial subscribe-ability creates an assembly line.
* An assembly line can abstractify object storage and retreival.
* Middleware can be hot-swapped.


### Quick Faqts

* **all examples use coffee-script**
* coffee-script is zen-garden
* `cake dev` watches & compiles & tests
* browseDirectory( [`./spec`](./spec) ).should.equal `clarity`
