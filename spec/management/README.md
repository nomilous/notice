### Creating a Manageable Hub

```coffee

notice = require 'notice'
NetworkAlertRouter = notice.hub

    ... # other config

    # 
    # error:
    #     keep: 10 # oldest first
    #

    introspector:
        level: 0  # none
        level: 1  # not none

    manager:
        listen: 
            # hostname: 'localhost'
            port: 11011
            key:  '/path/to/key'
            cert: '/path/to/cert'

        # 
        # authenticate: username: 'nomilous', password: 'âˆ†'
        # 
        # or: 
        # 

        authenticate: (username, password, callback) -> 

            #
            # perform upstream authentication
            # callback true if authetic
            # error is ignored, it just reposts the 401
            # 

            callback null, true


hub = NetworkAlertRouter.create( ...

```


### Hub Introspection and Middleware Performance Metrics

**pending consideration**

### Hotswapping Middleware

**pending consideration**

## * Will need to be able to replace more than one at a time (transaction,, **all in one turn**)
## * Transaction may need to include deletion and resequencing.
## * And possibly roll back.
* or first middleware can queue for upgrade duration

### Starting a Hub Instance

**pending consideration**
