    # ------------------------------------
    # 
    # * Middlewares are run in the sequence they were registered.
    # 
    # * Throws or uncaught Exceptions will terminate the sequence
    #   and the error is passed to the callback/promise at the
    #   message creator.
    # 

    throw new Error 'oh dear...' if msg.progress == '1 of 2'

    # 
    # * Middlewares can ammend the message and the final result
    #   is passed to the callback/promise at the message creator.
    #

    console.log 'on bus2:', JSON.stringify msg, null, 2

    # 
    # * Messages do not proceed to the next middleware until next()
    #   is called. This allows the middleware to perform an asynchronous 
    #   activity of some kind (eg. www/DB/wait ) and keep the message 
    #   on hold while doing so.
    # 

    next()

    #
    # * Never calling next() is a PROBLEM if the message creator is 
    #   expecting a final result.
