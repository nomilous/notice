    # 
    # * Messages do not proceed to the next middleware until done()
    #   is called. This allows the middleware to perform an asynchronous 
    #   activity of some kind (eg. www/DB/wait ) and keep the capsule 
    #   on hold while doing so.
    # 

    next()

    #
    # * Never calling done() is a PROBLEM if the capsule creator is 
    #   expecting a final result.
